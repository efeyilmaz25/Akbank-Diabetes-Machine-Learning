# Akbank-Diabetes-Machine-Learning
This project was developed for the "Akbank Machine Learning Bootcamp: New Generation Project Camp" training held in cooperation with Akbank and Global AI HUB.

The data set used for diabetes research on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over, belonging to the National Institute of Kidney Diseases in the USA, was examined. An attempt was made to develop a machine learning model that could predict whether people have diabetes or not, given their characteristics.

The project contains information to understand the basics of machine learning. This section provides information about variable types, learning types and problem types. Then "what is a machine learning model?" answers the question. It talks about model components, model success metrics, and model validation methods. After talking about the story of the data set, studies are carried out with the "EDA - (Exploratory Data Analysis)", "Data Pre-Processing", "Model Selection and Prediction", "Hyperparameter Optimization" and "Model Evaluation" sections.
